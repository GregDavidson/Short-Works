* Desirable Hybrid Automobile Technology

TL;dr: The best would be Series-Hybrid Automobiles with
- Sufficient battery capacity for most needs
- Excellent performance on battery only
- Good performance with combined Battery and Internal Combustion Generator
      - Allowing for extended range
- Mediocre performance with Internal Combustion Generator alone
      - Motivating owners to plug them in!

** Battery Electric, Series Hybrid, Parallel Hybrid

Electric and Hybrid Automobiles go back some time.
Consider the first three automobiles designed by Ferdinand Porsche:
- The C.2 Phaeton of 1898
      - A Battery-Electric Vehicle (BEV)
      - Front wheel drive
            - 2 electric motors mounted in the front wheel hubs
- The Toujour-Contente of 1900
      - A battery-electric automobile
      - All wheel drive
            - Electric motors mounted in the hubs of all four wheels
- The Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid of 1901
      - *the world's first hybrid automobile, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Series_hybrid][Series Hybrid]]*
      - Electric wheel hub motors as with the previous vehicles
      - Driven by an Internal Combustion Generator
      - Supplemented by a battery pack

A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Series_hybrid][Series Hybrid]] shares many of the advantages of a battery electric vehicle
- Great performance including high torque
- High efficiency including Regenerative Braking
- Simpler power train with far fewer mechanical components
      - Lower maintenance
- The Internal Combustion Generator in often called a /Range-Extender/
      - handy for unusually long trips
      - otherwise rarely used

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel%E2%80%93electric_powertrain][Serial-Hybrid Powertrains]] are widely used
- for locomotives
- for ships
- but not for automobiles or trucks!

The Toyota Prius of 1999
- a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Parallel_hybrid][Parallel Hybrid]]
- all of the complexity of an Internal Combustion Engine
      - mechanical components from engine to transmission to wheels
- no plug-in models until 2012
- moderately more efficient than ICE cars in its cals
      - uses regenerative-braking
      - uses a somewhat [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_cycle][more efficient ICE cycle]]
      - yet no more efficient than many compact ICE automobiles

Parallel Hybrid vehicles have
- most of the disadvantages of ICE vehicles
      - the complexity of ICE and BEV combined
- few of the advantages of battery electric vehicles
      - even the plug-in models have undersized battery packs
            - i.e. insufficient for typical daily needs

How could Toyota succeed with such a poor design?
- Toyota are the world's highest volume automobile manufacturer
- Toyota mastered the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve][Learning Curve]]
- Toyota internalized much of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming][Deming's]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control][Statistical Process Control]]
- The Prius was marketed as environmentally responsible
- The Prius was often eligible for government incentives

** What Kind of Hybrids are a Win-Win?

With Climate Change one of the major threats to the world, do Hybrids have a
role to play or should we go exclusively for Battery-Electric Vehicles (BEVs)?

First, we can rule out Parallel Hybrids, even Plug-In Parallel Hybrids for the
reasons already given.

Series Hybrids have /potential environmental advantages/ over BEVs
- Smaller battery pack
      - less weight, increasing vehicle efficiency, lessens road wear
      - less environmental impact from manufacturing
- /if they are almost-always externally recharged!/

Many people have been buying Plug-In Hybrids
- especially where there are discounts and other incentives
- [[https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1139858_phev-drivers-don-t-plug-in-so-often-and-epa-is-adjusting-to-it][and then they rarely plug them in!]]

Can a Series-Hybrid be good for both owners and the common good?

The ideal Series-Hybrid Automobile would have
- Sufficient battery capacity for most needs
      - Normal daily driving
      - Plug in at home overnight
      - If a heavy commute, Plug in at work
- Excellent performance on battery only
- Good performance with combined Battery and Internal Combustion Generator
      - Allowing for extended range
            - beyond BEV vehicles
            - as good as ICE vehicles
      - Adjust generator usage according to trip length
- Adequate performance with Internal Combustion Generator alone
      - Regenerative braking would give improved efficiency

Alas, such ideal vehicles are unlikely to be produced or desired without
government incentives aligned with this understanding.
