* The Naturalism Fallacy Fallacy

Is microwave cooking bad? Is nuclear power evil? Are raw foods better? Are
natural foods better for you? How about organic foods? Raw foods? Is nature
good? Is nature evil? If it feels good, is it good?

If something is natural, i.e. something which is an ancient feature of the
natural world and perhaps a traditional of human culture, I suggest we should be
suspicious of it, suspicious of whether it's good for us. The /Naturalism
Fallacy/ tells us that something being /natural/ in no way implies that it is
/good/.

If an innovative new practice feels intuitively strange and unnatural, I suggest
we should be suspicious of whether it's good for us, even more than we would be
suspicious of something "natural" and "traditional". The /Precautionary
Principle/ tells us that something being /new/, /innovative/, /modern/,
/progressive/, /scientific/ implies that it is better than something
/time-tested/.
