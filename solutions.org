* There Are Solutions!

Civilization is in a race between education and catastrophe. Let us learn the
truth and spread it as far and wide as our circumstances allow. For the truth is
the greatest weapon we have.

Many people today imagine that things are bad and getting worse. Nothing could
be further from the truth. The conditions of life for most human beings on the
planet are better than they've ever been. Less scarcity, less suffering, more
prosperity and more opportunities than ever. Yes, there are current difficulties
and the future is always uncertain. We need to navigate life carefully. But
undue pessimism leads us to make poor choices leading to worse outcomes!

** Education

- TL/DR :: The system of /top-down education/ used in most countries is
  expensive and produces mediocre results. This is said to be "a crisis". Much
  better systems have long available and are affordable, yet such better systems
  are routinely ignored or shunned.
  
Goals of a Basic Education:
- fluency in reading and writing
- fluency in the prestige dialect of at least two languages
- mathematical and scientific "literacy"
- emotional and cultural "literacy"
- clarity about what is currently known and unknown
  - including ourselves, our world and the Universe
- clarity about the kinds of skills and knowledge available to humans
- having a love of learning
- having effective skills for further learning

- TL/DR :: Adding more money and more years doesn't help much!

The [[https://www.oecd.org][Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - OECD]] runs a
[[https://www.oecd.org/pisa][Programme for International Student Assessment - PISA]] which regularly ranks the
performance of the world's youth in their educational attainments at age 15. The
PISA results for the United States are [[https://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/PISA2018_CN_USA.pdf][mediocre]] or even [[https://www.thebalance.com/the-u-s-is-losing-its-competitive-advantage-3306225Q][alarming]] given that only
one country (Luxembourg) spends more money per pupil. This result should not be
surprising as the US uses roughly the same top-down system of education as is
used by most schools in most countries and such systems give very consistent
results, despite differences in level of funding.

More than 100 years ago general education in the United States used to end in
eighth grade (ending around age 13 or 14) with expected educational attainments
beyond what graduates of today's secondary education (ending around age 17
or 18) commonly achieve. (This does not imply that most of the graduates of
primary education in 1895 achieved those goals either!) Over the years since,
the most common education system used in the United States (and many other
countries) has added many extra years (pre-school, kindergarten and "high
school") while failing to noticeably improve outcomes. It's now becoming common
to view college and university education as necessary supplements to achieve our
general education goals!

Over the same (more than 100 years) period of time, many better systems of
education have been developed - and mostly ignored worldwide for cultural,
political and institutional reasons. Adopting these better systems would exceed
our aspirations for universal education. The result would be revolutionary!

*** Montessori

Maria Montessori began developing her education system in 1897. She initially
offered her revolutionary system to the children of the poor, children living in
the slums of Rome. There is nothing particularly expensive about the Montessori
system. Yet today Montessori schools are among the most expensive and exclusive,
primarily serving the children of elite members of rich countries.

Montessori's system is designed to provide for all levels of primary and
secondary education, but is usually now only available for the youngest
(rich) children.

Since the beginning, Montessori Education has appeared to produce results
superior to the results of traditional systems of education. Making Montessori
education an available option for all children would be revolutionary.

*** Mastery Education

Mastery Education can take many forms.  Some key elements are
- Learning materials are organized into logical modules.
- Modules include integral activities and tests.
- Activities are often designed for small groups of students working together.
- The materials in each module are abundant, including extra materials
  sufficient to meet the needs of students with different backgrounds, needs,
  interests, aptitudes or learning styles.
- Abundant assistance is available from /proctors/, i.e. /Peer Facilitators/ who
  are typically students who completed the same course of study recently.
- Qualified proctors assess student's performance on the tests and activities
  and provide guidance towards the students mastering each module.
- Students are not judged or graded based on these assessments.
- Learning consists of mastering all the modules.
- Different students make take different paths through the materials.
- The amount of time available to complete each module is sufficiently flexible
  that all students should be able to master all modules.
- The /Peer Facilitators/ work with /subject matter experts/ to develop the
  abundant material for the modules.

One of the organized systems of Mastery Education is

*** Constructionism

*** Language and Reading

The success rate of children achieving fluency in foreign languages from
traditional school programs is very poor, i.e. most students get discouraged and
drop out or achieve limited proficiency even after multiple years of
instruction. It would be foolish to conclude from this that children find
learning foreign languages difficult, since children will naturally learn any
language regularly used in their environment to complete fluency without any
adult instruction. If we were serious about children learning additional
languages, we would arrange for such additional languages to be used in their
environment, e.g. having the language used in preschool and kindergarten be in a
second language and then using that second language for at least half of the
school day in primary school.

Reading proficiency presents a similar story. Conventional schooling teaches
reading as a consciously learned skill using reading materials that are not
interesting to the students. Most children do not become the kind of avid
readers who absorb written material much faster than speech and without the
"skill" requiring any conscious effort. "Native" readers learn reading by being
read to, e.g. sitting next to the reader or on the reader's lap, with the book
in the learner's lap. One must ensure that the learner has sufficient visual
acuity. Learners will typically become fluent readers in a few months. Learners
with dyslexia will usually also become fluent, although it will take longer.

It might be possible to supplement the exposure required to develop native
reading fluency by using a reading app running on tablets and phones which can
allow children to select among a wide variety of children's books (including
picture books) on diverse subjects and read them to the children, using eye
tracking and highlighting to synchronize the audio with the text. The children's
visual attention would place the children in total control of the pacing of the
reading and allow the children to read and revisit the material as many times as
they wish. If such a system worked well, it would be revolutionary!

*** The League Of Extraordinary Learners

The alternative to Top-Down Education (hold still kid while professionals do
education to you) is Learner-Centered Education. Learner Centered education
follows the belief, shared by people like Maria Montessori and Seymour Papert
that interested and engaged Learners have a capacity for learning that exceeds
anything which could possibly be provided by a Top-Down system.

The [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/loel][League of Extraordinary Learners - LOEL]] is a proposed design for a /Learning
Community/ which could facilitate /Mastery Education/ for all subjects free of
charge to /all learners/ of /all ages/ through the World Wide Web.

** Health and Longevity

*** Live Long Enough to Live Forever

Today's knowledge of every aspect of biology is vast and is rapidly expanding.
Our current abilities to prevent and treat diseases would be regarded as
miraculous any time in the past. And our knowledge is rapidly growing.

In a few years we will be able to prevent or cure every disease which plagues
humankind. We will soon be able to significantly slow some of the major
processes of aging and reverse some of those processes significantly.

A few years after that we will be able to stop and reverse aging entirely. If
you can live long enough to be alive in that era, you could live as long as you
like and take advantage of enhancements beyond our current imagination.

There are two pathways to this awesome future. The first is to maximize your
healthspan. Apply the knowledge we have about how to increase your health and
slow aging. Update your approach as knowledge increases. This should be a
no-brainer as it extends the quality as well as the length of your life.

If you're young enough now and if you manage to avoid accidents and diseases we
don't yet know how to treat well, you may be able to achieve /longevity escape
velocity/, i.e. to live long enough to take advantage of advances which allow you
to live still longer, and so on, until you reach the post-mortality era.

*** Traditions Around Death

Wise people have been practicing techniques for extending their healthspan for
all of recorded history and doubtless much earlier. It was well understood that
such practices could only delay, not prevent aging and death. Many ancient
traditions include attitudes and practices to help cope with the painful
circumstances of debilitation and death as gracefully as possible. The Stoics
often practiced euthanasia, a painless death at the end of a good life.

Human life seems so precious that many people have imagined that it might
somehow magically continue past our apparent death into some further realm. In
such a case there might be no point in trying to increase the length of one's
life. Instead, one might optimize the afterlife possibilities via magical
rituals, appeals to supernatural beings, etc. This attitude fuels the popularity
and political power of the religions which promise life after death to their
adherents. The most politically successful religions consider euthanasia to be
morally wrong and have often insisted that all measures to prolong life must be
used, regardless of cost and regardless of the suffering caused by heroic
medical procedures at the end of life. Why is this relevant to our desire to
live forever in this world?  Read on!

*** Plan B

If you are not young and lucky enough, there is still a way you could reach the
post-mortality era: reversible suspension of life or /suspended animation/. The
only current technology for this is /cryonic suspension/, a careful lowering of
your body's temperature, using /cryoprotectants/ to prevent the formation of
destructive ice crystals. /Cryonic Suspension/ /vitrifies/ your body into a
glassy solid within which all physiological processes are suspended. There are
three problems with this approach at the current time:
- We can't currently avoid all damage during the vitrification process
- We can't yet reverse the vitrification process to bring you back to life
- Legal restrictions prohibit starting suspension before legal death

Reasonable extrapolations of the technological capabilities in the
post-mortality era suggest that it will become possible to reverse cryonic
suspension, as long as there has not been too much damage to the body before it
was vitrified. For example, once we fully develop molecular nanotechnology,
which is likely just a matter of a few decades, both suspension and
revivification should be reliable and inexpensive. If we had such a capability
now, it would be legal to suspend you as soon as you determined that your
quality of life was no longer acceptable - under the same circumstances as a
Stoic might choose euthanasia. An option for people who would like to reach the
post-mortality era but who doubt that they will be able to live that long is to
arrange for cryonic suspension immediately after legal death in the hope that
future technology will be able to reverse the damage done by the processes of
dying. Some of us hope that social attitudes and laws will change so that if
disease or aging destroys the quality of our life, we can utilize cryonic
suspension to avoid a painful death and maximize the chance of an afterlife in
/this/ world!

** Climate Change

Currently we have a large number of current options for slowing the increase
of Climate Change.  A great list is at

- [[https://www.drawdown.org/solutions][Project Drawdown Climate Change Solutions Inventory]]

We don't have the ability to immediately stop the practices which are causing
Climate Change, but we can do the next best thing: We can tax them in proportion
to the danger that they pose. Taxing any harmful externality that can't simply
be prohibited tends to work wonders, as it then directs the market to optimize
the most efficient use of the available solutions.

Specifically, what we need is a /Carbon Tax/ - a tax on the emission of any
greenhouse gas, principally Carbon Dioxide but also other gases like Methane
which operate similarly. The way the world trading system works is 
each country adopting a /Carbon Tax/ creates an incentive for their trading
partners to adopt a similar tax until it becomes universal.

What we need to do right now is to slow the increase of Climate Change. As we
develop more technological options we need to use them to further slow that
increase and then to stop it and then to reverse it. Ultimately we will have
total control over the worlds climate and weather. In the meantime, we need to
minimize human suffering and (because we're awesome) minimize ecological damage.

Some of the best /current solutions/ now (see the Drawdown Link above)
- More and better Solar and Wind Power
- More and better energy storage
      - Flow batteries are particularly good!
- Replacing combustion with electricity
- More and better portable energy sources
      - Battery electric vehicles
- Maximise use of Biochar to improve soil
- Ocean fertilization with Iron and possibly other micronutrients
- Develop Green Hydrogen-powered airplanes
- Develop Green Ammonia-powered ships

Near future solutions
- Continue improving the above
- Switch to Green Hydrogen-powered airplanes
- Switch to Green Ammonia-powered ships

Further in the future
- Molecular Nanotech systems to remove CO2

** Prosperity

We know how to grow enough food and make enough of all of the material things,
including housing to give every person on the planet the kind of material
prosperity currently enjoyed by middle-class people in the first world, including making
such.

** The Future

#+begin_quote
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable form
magic. - Arthur C Clarke
#+end_quote

Viewed form our privileged position, it is now clear that as long as human
beings have existed, we have been growing our knowledge base which has been
growing our capabilities and that these then increase the rate at which we can
grow our knowledge further and on and so forth in an exponential process.
