* The Cooker

This is a place for exploring and developing works which are not part of a
larger project. Many of these works will wind up on the "back burner" and may be
effectively abandoned. Works which achieve merit will be indexed so they have a
stable reference.

Please simply ignore (or pretend to ignore) the works in this Folder unless I've
specifically asked you for feedback on something here.

Yes, I could make it private, but as nothing here is actually sensitive, it's
more convenient to have it public but ignored.

I recommend ignoring anything that is not indexed, unless you've been specifically
been directed to it, perhaps to help in its development.

Currently Indexed:

Nada, Null, Nihil, Zip!
