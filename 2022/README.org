* Draft Folder

This folder is for drafts which may change or disappear without notice.

Please simply ignore (or pretend to ignore) the works in this Folder unless I've
specifically asked you for feedback on something here.

Yes, I could make it private, but as nothing here is actually sensitive, it's
more convenient to have it public but ignored.
