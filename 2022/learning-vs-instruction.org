* Education: Learning vs. Instruction vs. Training

For the purposes of this article I will be using some common terms in very
specific ways.

- Learning :: Learner-Directed growth of Knowledge and Understanding in specific
  domains in alignment with the Learner's natural learning processes and
  intrinsic reward systems. Experts only allowed to facilitate, not control the
  process. Examples and characteristics:
      - Immersive learning of languages
      - Montessori education
      - Immersive Simulations
      - Assessments are for feedback only
      - Loose time frame of learning process
      - No penalty if student does not complete something
      - Abstractions are built through exploration
      - Expert's models provided after learner has their own intuitions
      - Result is simply what was learned
            - Planned and unplanned learning
            - Learning how to learn

- Instruction :: Acquisition of knowledge and understanding guided by experts,
  often accompanied by evaluations that are considered a long-term measure of the
  student's quality. Experts control the process but are not themselves graded.
  Examples and characteristics:
      - lecture-recitation or programmed instruction
      - explanations provided in advance of practice
      - reproduction of correct theory then of correct methodology
      - homework assignments, tests, grades
      - Result is an assessment of student quality
            - Based on how well they performed in the process
            - Not just on what they now know, understand and can do
      - Result goes on their permanent record
            - Used to judge the student's quality

- Training :: Building and refining specific skills, especially with specific
  competency standards. Examples and characteristics:
      - drill and practice
      - worksheets
      - timed goals
      - ranking and competition
